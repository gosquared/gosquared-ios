# GoSquared iOS Change Log

## 2016-05-17, [v0.3.0]

### Added

- Added `GSPageview` class to contain and generate pageview related data and request bodies
- `GSTrackerEvent` is now used as an internal model for generating request bodies
- Send engagement time â€” this will only use the time that the app is the foreground app on your device, unless you have background tracking enabled

### Changed

- Pageview tracking logic now all sits in `GSTracker`
- Most methods now generate request bodies from their related model classes instead of within `GSTracker`. People methods still generate bodies within the main tracker
- Fixed issue where pinging would always continue in the background
- Specifiy item types for `NSArray`s in method parameters

### Removed

- Removed `GSPageviewTracker` in favour of tracking logic being in the main tracker, and request bodies being generated in `GSPageview` classes


## 2016-05-09, [v0.2.0]

### Added

- Added option to continue pinging when app enters background (only needed for apps that continually run in the background)
- Added ability to track events without properties parameter (was incorrectly docuemtned as being possible, sorry!)

### Changed

- Networking now uses `NSURLSession` instead of the deprecated `NSURLConnection`
- Improved singleton implementation for `sharedTracker` and `currentDevice`
- Retry pageview if pinging times out (more reliable online visitor count and pinging)
- Rename `GSRequestLogLevel` to `GSLogLevel`
- General refactoring and bringing code up to modern Obj-C practices
- `anonID` renamed to `visitorId`
- `currentPersonId` renamed to `personId`
- `identified` method is now available as `isIdentified` property

### Removed

- Removed tracking events with `GSTrackerEvent`
- Removed tracking by `UIViewController`


## 2016-04-07, [v0.1.2]

### Changed

- Tracker no longer logs information when identifying a user.

## 2016-03-16, [v0.1.1]

### Removed

- Removed `secret` property on tracker, which was accidently left in, but never used.

## 2016-03-16, [v0.1.0]

### Added

- Added nullablity annotations so usage in swift is a little nicer

### Changed

- Categories folder was renamed to Autoload to match the naming elsewhere

## 2015-12-18, [v0.0.9]

### Added

- Added support for tvOS from @steve228uk

### Changed

- Paths will now only be set if explicitly provided in the `trackScreen:withPath:` method.

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with URLs being sent in a way that we parse the path as `null`

## 2015-12-15, [v0.0.7]

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where `GSRequest.h` was not public (adds support for manual and Carthage installation)

## 2015-12-15, [v0.0.6]

### Added

- Added ability to set the amount of request information logged. Set `logLevel` on `GoSquared.sharedTracker()` to one of `Debug`, `Quiet` or `Silent`. `Quiet` by default.

## 2015-12-09, [v0.0.5]

### Changed

- Rename files, classes, variables, methods to use "pageview" as one word

### Fixed

- Fix issue where unique visitors for a time period were not being tracked correctly

## 2015-12-03, [v0.0.4]

### Added

- Added helper methods for tracking transactions: `trackTransaction:items:` and `trackTransaction:items:properties:`
- Added helper initialiser for `GSTransactionItem`s: `transactionItemWithName:price:quantity:`

### Changed

- Deprecated `GSTrackerEvent`. Use `trackEvent:withProperties:` method instead
- Deprecated `trackViewController:` methods. Use `trackScreen:` methods instead (note: this has same functionality, but the API is clearer)

### Fixed
